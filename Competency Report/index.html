            <h2>Here is my small, but interesting Biography</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="first-p">From an early age I have been wondering through this vast yet small world searching for <i>something</i>. Much like anyone's journey, mine started with....</p>
            <br>
            <p class="second-p">I was kidding, <mark>I will not bore you with small and irrelevant details.</mark> Let's cut straight to the point <ins>the things you should</ins> know about me. My favorite food is <del>good burger</del> <del>cheesy delicious pizza</del> brocoli.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="third-p">My hobbie is ripping through the streets on my motorcycle going <b>140 MPH!!!</b> That was another joke, however I do own a motorcycle for which I rode for a little over 1,000 miles (Seattle to San Diego) this weekend alone. That may be my hobbie, but my passion lays in traveling and meeting new people, my motorcycle is what I use to get there.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="fourth-p">Born in the city with the lady that talks about liberty, New York, but I was raised in the city that is home to the best Cuban sandwiches, Miami. Which brings me to the next topic, I decided to graduate from Florida International University (Go Panthers!)<sub>1</sub> That way my pride for where I come from remains. My expectations for this cohort is simple</p>
